		<b>How to Use</b>

		<p><b>The Basics</b></p>
		<p>The default display shows all available botanical samples collected by Ynes Mexia during her travels. The samples are classified by the level of detail available for establishing a location for the sample--this is referred to as the sample's level of precision. Samples are grouped into one of three levels of precision. The lowest level of precision is referred to as "State" level; these samples have only rough estimates of their location available. The middle level of precision is the "City" level and represents samples where a basic idea of the sample's origin was available. The highest level of precision is the "Sub-city" level, and these samples have the most information available for establishing sample origins.</p>
		<p>To view information about a specific sample, click on the sample point in the Google Map to bring up an information window describing the sample. Available information includes the scientific name of the sample, the collection sample number, the plant family for the sample, the location the sample was found in (the state and any additional descriptives about the location), when the sample was collected, who determined the official plant typology, and the EPA bioregions the sample would currently be found in (for more information about EPA bioregions, please refer to the FAQs section). Finally, an image of the sample is provided.
		<p><b>Searching the Sample Collection</b></p>
		<p>There are multiple ways to search the botanical samples collected by Ynes Mexia.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You can select all botanical samples available for a specific state by selecting the desired state from the list shown in the right-hand side of the website. When a state is selected from the list, the available collected samples for the selected state will be shown as points on the Google Map once the "Subset Collection" button is clicked.</li>
			<li>The precision level can also be used to filter the available botanical samples. Three levels of precision are available, though currently sample data are only available at either the city or sub-city level. Select "City" or "Sub-city" from the list on the right to show all the corresponding samples in the Google Map once the "Subset Collection" button is clicked.</li>
			<li>A subset of the botanical samples can be selected using one of three descriptives available about the botanical samples. The textbox labeled "Sample Descriptive" in the right-hand panel should be used to search by a specific botanical sample number, plant species, or plant scientific name. Select the radio button corresponding to the desired search method (sample number, sample species, or sample scientific name) and click the "Select Samples" button to show the locations of any collected samples matching the identified descriptive. *Note: at this time, searches using this feature are literal. The search will only return samples which match entries in the botanical sample database exactly. Searches for "Undetermined" and "undetermined" will return different results.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Other Features</b></p>
		<p>To toggle the display of the state boundaries, use the "State Boundaries" checkbox in the right-hand panel of filters and click on the "Subset Collection" button. *Note: this checkbox currently does not maintain the selection when using the "Sample Descriptive" search options immediately prior to changing the boundary display.</p>
		<p>To return the Google Map to its default settings, click the "Restore Default" button.</p>
