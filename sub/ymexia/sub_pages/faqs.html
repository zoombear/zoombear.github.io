		<b>FAQs</b>
		<p><b>Q: Where do I access maps of North American ecoregions?</b></p>
		<p><b>A:</b> For maps depicting the level 1, 2, and 3 ecoregions for North America used as reference for these data, as well as data for use in major GIS applications, please go to the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/ecoregions/na_eco.htm" target="_blank">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency North America Ecoregions web site</a> (link will open in new window).</p>

		<p><b>Q: I want to see the EPA ecoregions for Mexico in Google Earth. How do I do this?</b></p>
		<p><b>A:</b> To view the EPA ecoregions for Mexico in Google Earth, download a KML file of the regions <a href="../downloads/EcoRegions.kmz">here</a>.</p>

		<p><b>Q: I want to see the Mexico state boundaries in Google Earth. How do I do this?</b></p>
		<p><b>A:</b> To view the state boundaries for Mexico in Google Earth, download a KML file of the boundaries <a href="../downloads/MexStatesLine.kmz">here</a>.</p>

		<p><b>Q: Why is the State of Puebla identified in the search filter as Pueblo?</b></p>
		<p><b>A:</b> Available data have been entered as presented in Ynes Mexia's botanical collection journal. When the samples were collected, the State of Puebla was identified as Pueblo.</p>

		<p><b>Q: Some botanical sample points are sitting in the ocean. Why?</b></p>
		<p><b>A:</b> In order to prevent samples with the same journal-specified location from obscuring each other, the locations for the samples were randomized to sit up to a specified distance away from the sample's defined original location. The distance used to randomize locations varied depending on the sample's identified level of precision. The more precise the location description, the smaller the distance used to randomize the location. This process, when used on samples located on the coast, can generate locations which appear off-shore. The description of the sample location can be found in the sample's information window when the sample point is clicked on.</p>

		<p><b>Q: I used the text field to select samples meeting a sample descriptive I chose, but now want to change the display of the state boundaries. How do I do this?</b></p>
		<p><b>A:</b> The easiest way to accomplish this is to toggle the state boundaries display and subset the collection using the first (list) search method and then perform any search using the second (text-field) search method.</p>
